For agency owners, there is a common pattern to create many different organization to manage differnet client's projects.

For this usecase, we have introduced share billing for all our clients - Here's how to enable it:

1. Go into **/settings** page

2. On a free account - go to **"Parent Organization"** section and select the agency organization. 

3. Select the parent oganization you would like to link for billing.

Now all your usage is tied to one account - and you can share analytics / stats with different clients without worrying about exposing other client's information
