## Shared Numbers

We recommend starting out with shared numbers. CallCow maintains a pool of phone numbers that are shared for all accounts.

When deciding which number to use for a given workflow, we look at the recipient number's area code, and we try to route the call with numbers in the similar area.

## Dedicated Numbers

If you have dedicated numbers in your organization, CallCow will prioritize using the dedicated numbers. If all dedicated numbers are busy, we will fall back to using shared numbers.

There are 2 ways to get dedicated numbers:

1. Bring your own twilio account

Set up on twilio with your own twilio Account ID and twilio Access Token. You can add you own twilio number in the "Numbers" tab.

2. Let Callcow purchase numbers on your behalf

Setting up twilio can be a hassle. If you need us to purchase numbers on your behalf, email us at yiming@callcow.ai or hanyiming1995@gmail.com, we will purchase the numbers for you and add it to your account.
