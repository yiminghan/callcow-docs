CallCow uses Twilio to handle phone calls. To connect your own Twilio account, you'll need to get a phone number and API credentials.

## Getting a Twilio Phone Number

1. Sign up for a Twilio account at [twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com)

2. Once logged in, go to **Phone Numbers** > **Manage** > **Buy a number**

3. Search for a number by country, area code, or capabilities (Voice, SMS)

4. Click **Buy** to purchase the number

5. Copy the phone number and add it to your CallCow workflow settings

## Getting Your Twilio API Credentials

1. Log in to the [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com)

2. On the dashboard, locate your **Account SID** and **Auth Token**

3. Click the eye icon to reveal your Auth Token

4. Copy both the Account SID and Auth Token

5. Paste these credentials into CallCow's Twilio integration settings

**Note:** Keep your Auth Token secret. Never share it publicly or commit it to version control.

## Concurrent Calls Limit

CallCow uses Twilio for phone calls. By default, Twilio accounts have the following limits:

| Account Type | Calls Per Second (CPS) | Concurrent Calls |
|--------------|------------------------|------------------|
| Trial | 1 CPS | 4 |
| Upgraded (without Business Profile) | 1 CPS | Limited |
| Upgraded (with Business Profile) | Configurable | Unlimited |

**Key points:**
- CPS limits only apply to outbound API calls, not inbound calls
- If you need higher throughput, you can increase your CPS limit in the [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com) Voice Settings page (requires an approved Business Profile)
