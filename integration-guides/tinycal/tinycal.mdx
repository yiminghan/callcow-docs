title: "TinyCal Integration Setup"

For TinyCal Integration, you will need to configure an API key for us to create schedules for you on your behalf.

Here's the step by step guide to get your API KEY:

1. Go to [tinycal.com](https://tinycal.com) and log in to your account

2. Navigate to Settings > API & Integrations

3. Click on "Generate API Key" or "Create New Token"

4. Make sure the key never expires (if the option is available)

5. Copy the API key and paste it into CallCow's TinyCal integration settings

## Security Considerations

Using an API Key in this way is <b>100% Safe</b>.

Any time you feel like you want to stop connecting to CallCow, just remove the integration and revoke the key on TinyCal's settings page.

There is no way for us to access your calendar after.
